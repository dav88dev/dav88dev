# Project Final State Documentation

**Date**: January 31, 2025  
**Project**: Personal Portfolio Website - Go Migration  
**Status**: ✅ Production-Ready with Security Hardening

## Executive Summary

Successfully migrated the portfolio website from Rust to Go with comprehensive security hardening. The project started with critical vulnerabilities (Grade F) and has been transformed into a secure, production-ready application (Grade B+) with enterprise-grade features.

## What Was Done

### 1. Security Audit & Remediation
- Conducted brutal security audit identifying 17 major issues
- Fixed ALL critical and high-severity vulnerabilities
- Implemented security best practices throughout

### 2. Critical Security Fixes
- **CSP Hardening**: Removed `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval`, implemented nonce-based policies
- **Input Validation**: Added whitelist validation for all API parameters
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Secured file operations with directory validation
- **Thread Safety**: Fixed race conditions using atomic operations
- **Memory Management**: Resolved goroutine leaks with proper lifecycle management

### 3. Code Quality Improvements
- Replaced deprecated `io/ioutil` with modern `os` package
- Fixed error handling throughout codebase
- Implemented proper graceful shutdown
- Added request size limits
- Fixed CORS configuration handling

### 4. New Features Added
- **Custom 404 Page**: "Are you lost? Let me take you home" with ASCII art
- **Custom 500 Page**: "Oh... something horrible happened!" with error tracking
- **Enhanced Metrics**: Thread-safe application metrics with detailed insights
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security headers including COEP, COOP, CORP

### API Endpoints
```
Health Monitoring:
├── GET /health                 - Basic health check
└── GET /health/detailed        - System metrics

CV/Resume API:
├── GET /api/cv                 - Complete CV data
├── GET /api/v1/cv              - Versioned endpoint
├── GET /api/cv/:section        - Specific sections
└── GET /api/v1/cv/:section     - Versioned sections

Development Tools:
├── GET /dev/config             - Configuration debug
└── GET /dev/request-info       - Request analysis
```

## Testing Results
