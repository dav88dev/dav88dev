# Mobile Site Audit Checklist

## Current Status
✅ **Mobile Navigation FIXED** - Completely separate navigation systems implemented
- Desktop: `.desktop-navbar` (shown >768px)
- Mobile: `.mobile-navigation` (shown ≤768px)
- Zero CSS conflicts, fully functional hamburger menu with visible links

## Areas to Audit & Fix

### 1. Layout Issues
- [ ] Header/Hero section mobile layout

- [ ] Grid layouts (about, projects, skills)
- [ ] Timeline component (experience section)
- [ ] Contact form layout
- [ ] Footer responsive layout

### 2. Typography & Spacing
- [ ] Font sizes on mobile (too large/small)
- [ ] Line height adjustments
- [ ] Margin/padding between sections
- [ ] Text alignment issues
- [ ] Heading hierarchy on mobile

### 3. Component Issues
- [ ] Cards (project cards, education cards)
- [ ] Buttons (hover states, sizing)
- [ ] Forms (contact form mobile layout)
- [ ] Images (logo, project images)
- [ ] Skills visualization (canvas/interactive elements)

### 4. Interactive Elements
- [ ] Scroll animations (may need mobile optimization)
- [ ] Hover effects (convert to touch-friendly)
- [ ] Three.js canvas responsiveness
- [ ] GSAP animations on mobile

### 5. Performance & UX
- [ ] Mobile loading performance
- [ ] Touch targets (minimum 44px)

## Known Issues from Previous Work
1. **Timeline styles** - Some responsive styles were accidentally removed and restored
2. **Hero section** - May need mobile layout adjustments
3. **Skills section** - Canvas element might not be mobile-optimized
4. **General spacing** - Some elements may look off after navigation changes

## Testing Strategy
1. **Mobile device testing** using Selenium/Playwright
2. **Cross-device validation** (iPhone, Android, tablets)
3. **Screenshot comparison** before/after fixes
4. **Interactive element testing** (touch, scroll, navigation)

## Build Process
```bash
cd frontend && npm run build
cargo run --release
```
