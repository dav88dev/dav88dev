```

## Migration Complexity Assessment

### Overall Complexity: **MEDIUM**

### Complexity Factors

#### Low Complexity Components
- **Configuration management** - Similar patterns
- **JSON API endpoints** - Go excels at JSON
- **Static file serving** - Direct equivalent middleware
- **Health checks** - Trivial in Gin
- **CORS/Compression** - Well-established middleware

#### Medium Complexity Components
- **Template migration** - Syntax differences between Tera and Go templates
- **Routing patterns** - Different middleware chaining approach
- **Error handling** - Rust's Result<T,E> vs Go's error interface
- **Asset path management** - Needs restructuring for Go conventions

#### High Complexity Components (if applicable)
- **WASM integration** - May need verification of compatibility
- **Custom HTTP/2 implementation** - Go's standard library handles this differently
