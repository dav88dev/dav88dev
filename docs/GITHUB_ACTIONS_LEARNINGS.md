# GitHub Actions & Docker CI/CD: Complete Learning Guide

## üìö Overview

This document captures all learnings from implementing comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows with Docker deployment, security scanning, and performance optimization. It serves as both documentation and future reference for best practices discovered through Context7 MCP research and hands-on implementation.

## üîç Always Use Context7 MCP

**CRITICAL**: Always use Context7 MCP for getting the latest documentation and best practices. This was emphasized multiple times and is essential for staying current with rapidly evolving tools.

### Key Context7 Libraries Used
- `/docker/metadata-action` - Docker metadata extraction and tagging
- `/10up/engineering-best-practices` - Git workflow and development practices
- Various search queries for latest Docker and GitHub Actions practices

## üèóÔ∏è Docker Build Optimization

### Multi-Stage Dockerfile Best Practices

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: WASM Builder (conditional)
FROM rust:1.83-alpine AS wasm-builder
RUN apk add --no-cache curl musl-dev
RUN curl https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/init.sh -sSf | sh
WORKDIR /wasm
COPY wasm-frontend/ ./
RUN if [ -f "Cargo.toml" ]; then \
        wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir ../static/wasm; \
        echo "‚úÖ WASM build completed"; \
    else \
        echo "‚ÑπÔ∏è No WASM project found - creating empty wasm directory"; \
        mkdir -p ../static/wasm; \
    fi
```

**Key Learnings:**
- Conditional builds prevent failure when dependencies don't exist
- Each stage should have a specific purpose (build tools, dependencies, runtime)
- Use Alpine images for smaller attack surface and faster builds
- Order layers from least to most frequently changing

### Docker Metadata Action Configuration

```yaml
- name: üè∑Ô∏è Extract metadata
  id: meta
  uses: docker/metadata-action@v5
  with:
    images: ${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}
    tags: |
      type=ref,event=branch
      type=ref,event=pr
      type=sha,prefix={{branch}}-
      type=raw,value=latest,enable={{is_default_branch}}
      type=schedule,pattern={{date 'YYYYMMDD'}}
    labels: |
      org.opencontainers.image.title=Portfolio Website
      org.opencontainers.image.description=Interactive personal portfolio with Go backend and WASM frontend
      org.opencontainers.image.vendor=dav88dev
      org.opencontainers.image.url=https://dav88.dev
      org.opencontainers.image.source=https://github.com/dav88dev/dav88dev
      org.opencontainers.image.documentation=https://github.com/dav88dev/dav88dev#readme
      org.opencontainers.image.licenses=MIT
    annotations: |
      org.opencontainers.image.title=Portfolio Website
      org.opencontainers.image.description=Interactive personal portfolio with Go backend and WASM frontend
      org.opencontainers.image.vendor=dav88dev
    flavor: |
      latest=auto
```

**Key Learnings:**
- Use semantic tagging strategies (branch, PR, SHA, latest)
- Include comprehensive OCI image annotations for better metadata
- Annotations are newer than labels and provide better integration
- `flavor: latest=auto` handles latest tag automatically for default branch

### Enhanced Docker Caching Strategy

```yaml
cache-from: |
  type=gha
  type=registry,ref=${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:buildcache
cache-to: |
  type=gha,mode=max
  type=registry,ref=${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:buildcache,mode=max
```

**Key Learnings:**
- Use dual caching strategy: GitHub Actions cache + Registry cache
- GitHub Actions cache: Fast, limited to 10GB, scoped to branches
- Registry cache: Unlimited, shareable across organization, persistent
- `mode=max` caches all layers vs `mode=min` (final stage only)
- Registry cache supports multi-stage builds better than inline cache

## üîí Security Best Practices

### Comprehensive Security Scanning Workflow

Created `security-scan.yml` with multiple layers:

1. **Dependency Scanning** (Trivy)
2. **Secrets Scanning** (GitLeaks)
3. **Dockerfile Security** (Hadolint)
4. **Static Code Analysis** (CodeQL)

### GitLeaks Configuration

```toml
title = "Portfolio Website GitLeaks Configuration"

[extend]
useDefault = true

[[rules]]
id = "generic-api-key"
description = "Generic API key"
regex = '''(?i)(api[_-]?key|apikey)['"]*\s*[:=]\s*['"][a-zA-Z0-9_\-]{16,}['"]'''

# Allowlist for specific patterns
[[rules.allowlist]]
paths = [
    ".gitleaks.toml",
    "docs/",
    "*.md",
    "frontend/src/js/",
]
regexes = [
    '''test[_-]?secret''',
    '''example[_-]?key''',
]
```

**Key Learnings:**
- Use allowlists to prevent false positives
- Scan on both push/PR events and weekly schedule
- Upload SARIF results to GitHub Security tab for centralized view
- Different tools catch different types of vulnerabilities

### Enhanced Permissions

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read          # Required for checkout
  packages: write         # Required for pushing to GHCR
  id-token: write        # Required for OIDC token generation
  actions: read          # Required for build attestations
  attestations: write    # Required for build attestations
```

**Key Learnings:**
- Be explicit about required permissions
- Comment each permission for clarity
- OIDC tokens provide better security than long-lived secrets
- Attestations require specific permissions for SBOM/provenance

## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

### Build Performance

1. **Multi-platform builds**: `linux/amd64,linux/arm64`
2. **Parallel caching**: GitHub Actions + Registry
3. **Build arguments**: `BUILDKIT_INLINE_CACHE=1`
4. **SBOM & Provenance**: `provenance: true, sbom: true`

### Deployment Performance

```yaml
# Prevent concurrent deployments
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref_name }}
  cancel-in-progress: false
```

**Key Learnings:**
- Prevent overlapping deployments with concurrency control
- `cancel-in-progress: false` for deployment safety
- Use environment protection rules for production deployments

## üöÄ Zero-Downtime Deployment Strategy

### Health Check Implementation

```bash
# Health check with retries
for i in {1..30}; do
  if curl -f http://localhost:8001/health > /dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "‚úÖ New container is healthy!"
    break
  elif [ $i -eq 30 ]; then
    echo "‚ùå New container failed to start"
    exit 1
  fi
  sleep 2
done
```

### Blue-Green Deployment Insights

From Context7 research, discovered several blue-green strategies:
1. **Docker Compose approach**: Use health checks to determine active container
2. **Traefik integration**: Automatic load balancing between healthy containers
3. **Manual port switching**: Start new container, test, switch traffic

**Key Learnings:**
- Health checks are critical for zero-downtime deployments
- Always test new container before switching traffic
- Implement rollback mechanisms for failed deployments
- Use proper grace periods for container shutdown (90s timeout)

## üîß CI/CD Workflow Architecture

### Workflow Structure

1. **CI Pipeline** (`ci.yml`):
   - Frontend tests (ESLint, build)
   - WASM tests (conditional)
   - Backend tests (Go fmt, vet, tests)
   - Security scanning
   - Integration tests

2. **Docker Deployment** (`docker-deploy.yml`):
   - Dockerfile security scan
   - Multi-platform build with caching
   - Container health testing
   - Zero-downtime deployment
   - Post-deployment verification

3. **Semantic Release** (`semantic-release.yml`):
   - Automated version management
   - Changelog generation
   - Git tag creation
   - Production deployment trigger

4. **Security Scanning** (`security-scan.yml`):
   - Dependency vulnerabilities
   - Secret detection
   - Code quality analysis
   - Scheduled monitoring

### Environment Variables Best Practices

```yaml
# Test environment setup
export SERVER_ENV=development
export SERVER_PORT=8000
export SECURITY_JWT_SECRET=test-jwt-secret
export SECURITY_SESSION_SECRET=test-session-secret
```

**Key Learnings:**
- Use appropriate environment variables for each context
- Test secrets should be obviously fake to prevent confusion
- Port consistency across all environments (8000 not 8080)
- Environment-specific configurations for development vs production

## üìñ Git Workflow Best Practices

### Branch Management

From Context7 `/10up/engineering-best-practices`:

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b fix/github-actions-deployment

# Merge with non-fast-forward to preserve history
git merge fix/github-actions-deployment --no-ff

# Clean up after merge
git branch -D fix/github-actions-deployment
git push origin --delete fix/github-actions-deployment
```

### Conventional Commit Messages

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'

)"
```

**Key Learnings:**
- Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Include detailed body explaining what and why
- Use bullet points for multiple changes
- Credit automation tools appropriately

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Port Mismatches
**Problem**: CI tests failing due to port 8080 vs 8000 inconsistency
**Solution**: Standardize on port 8000 across all environments

### Issue 2: Dynamic Image Tag Resolution
**Problem**: Using `${{ github.sha }}` directly in deployment scripts
**Solution**: Use `steps.meta.outputs.tags` with proper extraction:
```bash
IMAGE_TAG="$(echo '${{ steps.meta.outputs.tags }}' | head -n1)"
```

### Issue 3: Node.js Version Compatibility
**Problem**: Specific Node.js versions causing compatibility issues
**Solution**: Use `node-version: 'lts/*'` for latest LTS

### Issue 4: Conditional WASM Build
**Problem**: Build failing when WASM project doesn't exist
**Solution**: Implement conditional logic in Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
RUN if [ -f "Cargo.toml" ]; then \
        wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir ../static/wasm; \
    else \
        mkdir -p ../static/wasm; \
    fi
```

## üìä Monitoring & Observability

### Health Check Endpoints

```bash
# Production health monitoring
curl -f http://${{ env.PRODUCTION_SERVER }}:8000/health
```
