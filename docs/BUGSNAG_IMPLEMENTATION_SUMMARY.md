# Bugsnag Implementation Summary

**Date**: January 31, 2025  
**Developer**: Assistant  
**Status**: âœ… Complete

## What Was Done

### 1. Environment Configuration
- Added `BUGSNAG_API_KEY` to `.env` with the provided API key
- Updated `.env.example` to include placeholder for Bugsnag API key
- Kept API key secure and only in environment variables

### 2. Package Installation
- Installed `github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-go-gin` v1.0.0
- Installed `github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-go/v2` v2.6.1
- All dependencies resolved successfully

### 3. Backend Integration
- Added Bugsnag middleware to `main.go` after recovery middleware
- Configured to only run in production mode
- In development: errors are logged locally, Bugsnag is disabled
- Configuration includes:
  - API key from environment
  - Project packages for better stack traces
  - Release stage tracking
  - App version (1.0.0)

### 4. Frontend Performance Monitoring
- Added Bugsnag Performance script to `index.html`
- Uses module import with CSP nonce for security
- Tracks:
  - Page load performance
  - Core Web Vitals
  - Resource timing
  - Network requests

### 5. Security Updates
- Updated Content Security Policy to allow Bugsnag domains:
  - Script source: `d2wy8f7a9ursnm.cloudfront.net`
  - Connect sources: `notify.bugsnag.com`, `sessions.bugsnag.com`
- Maintains strict CSP with nonce-based approach

### 6. Testing Support
- Added `/dev/test-error` endpoint for testing error capture
- Verified middleware loads correctly
- Confirmed production-only behavior

### 7. Documentation
- Completely rewrote README.md with:
  - Current features including Bugsnag
  - Updated installation instructions
  - Error monitoring section
  - Deployment guides
  - Monitoring instructions
- Created detailed Bugsnag integration documentation
- Removed outdated content

## Key Features

### Production Mode
- Automatic error capture and reporting
- Performance monitoring active
- Errors sent to Bugsnag dashboard
- Release tracking enabled

### Development Mode
- Bugsnag disabled to avoid noise
- Errors logged to console
- Local debugging preferred
- Test endpoints available

## Configuration

```go
// Only in production
if cfg.IsProduction() {
    // Bugsnag middleware active
}
```

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Configure Bugsnag Dashboard**:
   - Set up error notifications
   - Configure error grouping rules
   - Set up performance budgets

2. **Advanced Integration**:
   - Add user context for authenticated requests
   - Custom metadata for debugging
   - Source map uploads for minified JS

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Set up alerts for error spikes
   - Monitor performance trends
   - Track deployment impact

## Testing Instructions

1. **Development Mode** (default):
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   # Should see: "Bugsnag disabled in development mode"
   ```

2. **Production Mode**:
   ```bash
   export SERVER_ENV=production
   export GIN_MODE=release
   ./portfolio-server
   # Should see: "Bugsnag error monitoring enabled (production)"
   ```

3. **Test Error Capture**:
   - Visit `/dev/test-error` in production mode
   - Check Bugsnag dashboard for captured panic

## Summary

Bugsnag has been successfully integrated with proper production/development separation, comprehensive documentation, and security considerations. The implementation follows best practices and is ready for production use.
