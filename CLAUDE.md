## Professional Experience Section Fixes

### Issues Fixed (2025-01-08)

#### 1. Timeline Item Alignment Problem
**Problem**: Timeline items in the Professional Experience section were misaligned and appeared shifted relative to the central timeline line.

**Root Cause**: The GSAP animation was applying horizontal transforms (`x: index % 2 === 0 ? -100 : 100`) to timeline items, causing them to slide in from left/right but creating visual misalignment.

**Solution**: 
- **File**: `frontend/src/js/main.js` (lines 147-161)
- **Change**: Removed the `x` transform from the GSAP timeline animation
- **Result**: Timeline items now maintain proper alignment with the central timeline line

```javascript
// Before (causing misalignment):
gsap.from(item, {
    x: index % 2 === 0 ? -100 : 100,
    opacity: 0,
    // ... other properties
});

// After (fixed alignment):
gsap.from(item, {
    // No x transform - items stay aligned
    // ... other properties
});
```

#### 2. Disappearing Text on Scroll
**Problem**: Professional Experience text would disappear during scroll transitions due to opacity animations.

**Root Cause**: Multiple conflicting animations:
1. CSS animation starting with `opacity: 0` 
2. GSAP animation also setting `opacity: 0`
3. ScrollTrigger conflicts with fullscreen snap scrolling

**Solution**:
- **File**: `frontend/src/css/style.css` (line 798)
- **Change**: Removed CSS opacity animation and set `opacity: 1` permanently
- **File**: `frontend/src/js/main.js` (line 158)
- **Change**: Removed `opacity: 0` from GSAP animation

```css
/* Before (causing disappearing text): */
.timeline-content {
    opacity: 0;
    animation: slideInTimeline 0.8s var(--easing-elastic) forwards;
}

/* After (always visible): */
.timeline-content {
    opacity: 1;
}
```

#### 3. Scroll Position Not Starting from Top
**Problem**: When scrolling to the Professional Experience section from any direction, the content wouldn't always start from the top position.

**Root Cause**: The Experience section has internal scrolling logic that maintains scroll position between transitions.

**Solution**:
- **File**: `frontend/src/js/main.js` (lines 435-441)
- **Change**: Added logic to reset scroll position to top when entering the Experience section

```javascript
// Added scroll reset when entering Experience section:
if (nextSection.id === 'experience') {
    const experienceContainer = nextSection.querySelector('.container');
    if (experienceContainer) {
        experienceContainer.scrollTop = 0;
    }
}
```

### Technical Details

#### Files Modified:
1. `frontend/src/css/style.css` - Removed opacity animation from timeline content
2. `frontend/src/js/main.js` - Fixed timeline alignment and added scroll reset logic

#### Animation System:
- **GSAP ScrollTrigger**: Handles timeline item animations
- **Fullscreen Snap Scrolling**: Manages section-to-section transitions
- **Internal Scrolling**: Allows scrolling within the Experience section before transitioning

#### Key CSS Classes:
- `.timeline-content` - Individual timeline item containers
- `.timeline-item` - Timeline entry wrapper with alternating layout
- `.timeline-dot` - Central timeline markers

#### Key JavaScript Functions:
- `initScrollAnimations()` - Sets up GSAP timeline animations
- `initSmoothScroll()` - Handles fullscreen snap scrolling
- `getCurrentSection()` - Detects currently visible section
- `getNextSection()` - Calculates next section for navigation

### Testing Notes
- Timeline items now properly align with central timeline line
- Professional Experience text remains visible during all scroll transitions
- Section always starts from top when entered from any direction
- Smooth animations preserved while fixing alignment issues
